This program derives the forward kinematics and a partial inverse kinematic function for a manipulator and they are implemented in a robot simulator.
Note: Part 2 needs to be updated.

Run instructions: 
> Build the Makefile (you only have to do this once):    xmkmf

> Compile the project:    make

This will produce a few warnings and show you whether there were errors  (ignore the can not build   Kinematics.man  error - this is just that it does not find documentation to build)

> Run the executable:  ./Kinematics.exe
